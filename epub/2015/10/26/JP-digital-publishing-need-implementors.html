    <p>Just attended JP Industry meetup (http://csslab.bpsinc.jp/wiki/index.php?JPIndustryMeetup)</p>

<p>In this meetup Fantasai (who is known as Elika as editor of http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/, http://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-decor-3/ and some other css specs) intduced about W3C progress based on http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2011/inside-csswg/ and a little bit about CSS relates to http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2012/css-layout-evolution/ to JP digital publishing related members. Also we had some discussions about what is most important in jlreq (http://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/).</p>

<p>First about spec process, in CSSWG basically there are three phases: Working Draft (WD), Candidate Recommendation (CR) and Recommendation (REC). Also added Last Call (LC) and Proposed Recommendation (PR). In all of the phases, PR and REC actually have not any technically difference. They are just different in process steps such as approval. If want to escape from CR to REC, we need two correct, independent implementations of each feature.</p>

<p>We also heard about Snapshot for CSS spec (like this one: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/). The goal of this status is: Specification is demonstrated to be stable via implementation and testing experience. It might be 100% not yet completed, but not further changes expected, just like REC.</p>

<p>So, we can compare Specs vs. Software as following:
Expolring</p>

<p>Software: Whiteboard drawings and discussions</p>

<p>Specs: pre-FPWD,  early WD
Revising</p>

<p>Software: Pre-alpha(prototyping)</p>

<p>Specs: mid-stage WD
Stabilizing</p>

<p>Software: Alpha(bleeding edge)</p>

<p>Specs: late-stage WD
Call for implementations</p>

<p>Software: Beta (read for early adoption)</p>

<p>Specs: early CR
Recommended</p>

<p>Software: x.0 Release(ready for everyone)</p>

<p>Specs: Snapshot CR
Finished</p>

<p>Software: x.1 Release(last bugs fixed)</p>

<p>Specs: PR, REC</p>

<p>In the second part of this meetup, which is a discussion session, it is started from question about “What part is most important for jlreq”.  That is a very good question since jlreq is a “large” and detailed requirement comes from paper publisher standard (JIS x 4051). When we have requirements and get agreement “ok, let’s do it”, well, next step is what we should or can start from. For example page rhythm has very high priority. Okay, we are gonna have CSS line-grid (https://drafts.csswg.org/css-line-grid/). Looks like everything can be resolved. But wait, take a look at line-grid, is it for Latin which is horizontal writing-mode? Yes, this is a start of discussion. How could vertical writing world contribute to it. The basic idea here is communicate more often, CSSWG is open for proposal. Well, how to do it for non-English world? How to make the proposals more make sense? For language, simple, learn it and use it. Many CSSWG members also come from non-English world, just not be afraid to speak wrong way (actually this motivated me pretty much, if you read this article, you can definitely know I am also not a native English user). For the second question, need propose (communicate) more frequently. Don’t need to wait for a complete finished draft to propose. Can just talk with CSSWG member and get advice from CSS perspective.</p>

<p>Okay, report of meetup is finished at here. Here are my questions. Who could do the task about gather priority for jlreq and make the proposal to CSSWG? And the second question is CSS (both spec or implementer) are basically for web site which is a scroll world. So, who and how to make the pagination world interested by them. Actually this is not only a problem for vertical writing mode. Even though for horizontal world, we also have same issues which DPUB-IG is related. Don’t forget, if want to escape from CR to next step, we need two correct, independent implementations. My thinking is these part should be handled by Reading System (RS) vendors with publisher tech guys. RS vendors (also include some community) should talk with publisher to make the proposal since their business depends on it while publishers already have physical paper market and digital publishing is only an option for them. Also, RS vendors can decide which rendering engine (Gecko? Webkit? Blink?) they can provide to publisher and user. So, they actually can connect to web browser vendor more closer to make it (two independent implementations) happen.</p>

<p>This meetup is a very good chance that digital publisher related member in Japan can talk with CSSWG directly and they can understand what is the issue block the way. From now, how to make this communication more frequently, who is gonna taking the responsibility to make things happen would be important.</p>
